# Evolution-of-Mutation-Rate
Interactive Matlab live scripts for exploring how mutation rate evolves with varying fitness functions and mutation kernels / spaces. The eigen_analysis file handle constant fitness functions, while the forward_euler file is compatible with frequency and/or time dependent fitness function. The traits_are_strings file considers traits from a genomic perspective, as finite strings on finite alphabets, with point mutations. 

This work is explained in the paper "The Point of No Return: Evolution of Excessive Mutation Rate is Possible Even for Simple Mutation Models" by Feng Fu and Brian Mintz.
